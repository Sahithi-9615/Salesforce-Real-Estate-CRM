# Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis

## Business Problem
Real estate agencies need a CRM system to manage properties, client interactions, and sales processes efficiently.

## Requirements
- Track all properties with availability status (For Sale / Sold / Under Negotiation)
- Manage client inquiries and property visits
- Automate follow-ups with leads
- Generate sales pipeline and revenue reports

## Stakeholders
- Admin: Configures Salesforce and manages system setup
- Real Estate Agents: Manage properties, handle client leads, schedule visits
- Sales Manager: Monitors team performance, approves high-value deals
- Customer Service: Handles post-sale services or support
- Clients/Buyers: Interact through web/portal forms, inquiries, or marketing campaigns

## Business Process
Lead generated (via portal/marketing) → Agent contacts client → Schedule property visit → Convert lead to Opportunity → Deal closed (property sold) → Post-sale support
